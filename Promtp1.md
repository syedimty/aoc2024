Creation of Innovative Technologies | Challenges in New Fields
Among the five key factors that Honda focuses on, regarding the carbon neutrality of power units, in addition to
the battery-related efforts mentioned in the “Electrification Business Strategy” (➡p.15), Honda is strengthening its
efforts towards commercialization by positioning “hydrogen,” which is anticipated as a clean energy source, as the
next-generation energy.
Honda has engaged in hydrogen technology and fuel cell vehicles, predating its competitors by a significant
margin since the late 1990s. Commencing with the R&D of fuel cells, which convert hydrogen and oxygen into
electricity, we have progressively enhanced performance while systematically addressing usability challenges.
This includes refining fuel cell dimensions, reducing costs and enhancing durability. The ensuing iteration of
fuel cell technology, developed in collaboration with GM since 2013, will be integrated into the forthcoming
generation of FCVs. Our intent is to expand the reach of this core technology—our next-generation fuel
cell system—not solely to our FCVs but also across an array of domains, encompassing commercial vehicles,
stationary power sources, construction machinery and diverse industrial equipment. We will aim to build a
hydrogen ecosystem.
Collaboration and cooperation with entities constituting the hydrogen value chain, spanning supply facets,
stand as imperative in the establishment of a comprehensive hydrogen ecosystem. Our engagement entails
fostering partnerships with companies pivotal to the hydrogen station network’s expansion. Notably, our
involvement with the Japan Hydrogen Station Network underscores our dedication to this pursuit. Moreover,
we collaborate with industry players such as Shell and FirstElement Fuel, actively engaged in the hydrogen
station domain in North America. Supplementary to these endeavors, we have embarked on exploratory
research into the potential applications of hydrogen technology in the aerospace sector, marking yet another
prospective avenue. Through these series of initiatives, we will contribute to the realization of a carbon-neutral
society by promoting the development of a comprehensive hydrogen ecosystem across the entire community.
Honda’s Hydrogen Ecosystem
Ever since my childhood, I’ve held a strong interest in environmental issues and even conducted independent
studies on fluctuations in Japan’s average temperatures. My introduction to Honda occurred during my
university years. I delved into research on fuel cells during my time at university, and serendipitously, my research
lab was engaged in a collaborative project with Honda. I vividly recall one of Honda’s technical experts visiting
our lab, radiating genuine enthusiasm and delight for their work. This experience left a lasting impression on
me, leading me to reflect, “Honda is a company where work is conducted with such freedom and joy.”
Transitioning to fuel cell vehicles that emit zero CO2 could yield a substantial environmental benefit. To truly
execute Honda’s electrification business strategy, we must direct our attention not solely to batteries but also
emphasize the significance of fuel cells. We have been committed to advancing R&D efforts, aiming to broaden
the scope of hydrogen fuel cell applications across a variety of sectors, encompassing passenger cars, commercial
vehicles, trucks and stationary power sources.
The advantages of hydrogen fuel cells encompass more than just environmental impact reduction; they
also encompass the utilization of hydrogen as an energy carrier. Unlike electricity, which is difficult to store in
substantial quantities for extended periods, hydrogen can be stored over long durations. For example, surplus
electricity produced at night can be converted into hydrogen and stored for later use. This becomes notably
valuable for island nations like Japan, which face limitations in abundant energy resources like oil. In the realms
of energy management and supply, I am convinced that our research assumes a crucial role.
Honda plays a significant role in mitigating environmental impact. To sustain its position as a global
frontrunner in environmental initiatives, my aspiration is for Honda to strive for world-class standing in the fuel
cell sector.

裏表紙 表紙
The dreams of each and every one of us working together have
always been the driving force of Honda.
We have different kinds of dreams, but by applying our original
technologies, ideas and design we take on challenges
continuously to realize mobility that enables our customers to
enjoy life with more freedom, more convenience and more fun.
The future mobility Honda dreams of will create a joy and
freedom of mobility that enables people to transcend the
constraints of time and place, and augment their every possibility.
Such mobility will become the “power” for people who are trying
to advance toward their own dreams.
Dreams that will move even more people, until there is an
endless expanse of new dreams.
The Power of Dreams
Through the creation of mobility we dream of, Honda will
become “The Power of Dreams” of more and more people.
That is how we will move people and society forward.
See p.4 Global Brand Slogan
Honda brand has been shaped by the accumulation of every individual business activity, walking hand in hand
with customers from its founding to the present. We recognize that enhancing Honda brand, which has been
crafted over 75 years of history, and elevating its value for the future is a critically important objective for
Honda.
In this period of significant transformation, we have redefined our global brand slogan, “The Power of
Dreams,” with the aim of clearly demonstrating the value it creates for customers worldwide and uniting all
associates to collectively work towards a common purpose. We believe that taking this beyond mere “words”
and aligning it with all aspects of our corporate activities, including products and services, and connecting it
to consistent implementation leads to the creation of an evolved Honda brand.
Based on this mindset, we position the redefined global brand slogan as the cornerstone of Honda’s brand
management, projecting the underlying beliefs onto various brand assets to establish a core of consistent
branding. We aim to establish an appealing brand that resonates with stakeholders by developing branding
based on a solid and unwavering common foundation, both within and outside the company. This will support
and drive creativity powered by the “dreams” of all associates working at Honda.
Furthermore, we will monitor the effectiveness of this brand management through the “Brand Value”
published by Interbrand, using it as a performance indicator to drive further advancements in our initiatives.
